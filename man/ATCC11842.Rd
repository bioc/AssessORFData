\description{
Objects of class \code{Assessment} and either
subclass \code{DataMap} or subclass \code{Results} for
\emph{Lactobacillus delbrueckii} subsp. \emph{bulgaricus} strain ATCC 11842
}
\details{
'ATCC11842_PreSaved_DataMapObj' is an object of subclass \code{DataMap}.

'ATCC11842_PreSaved_ResultsObj_GenBank' is an object of subclass
\code{Results} with predicted genes from the GenBank database.

'ATCC11842_PreSaved_ResultsObj_GeneMarkS2' is an object of subclass
\code{Results} with predicted genes from the program GeneMarkS-2.

'ATCC11842_PreSaved_ResultsObj_Glimmer' is an object of subclass
\code{Results} with predicted genes from the program Glimmer.

'ATCC11842_PreSaved_ResultsObj_Prodigal' is an object of subclass
\code{Results} with predicted genes from the program Prodigal.

For all 5 objects, values of two key identifying list items within
each object are listed below.
\itemize{
\item \code{StrainID}: ATCC11842
\item \code{Species}: L. delbrueckii bulgaricus
}
}
\section{Mapping object}{

The mapping object, 'ATCC11842_PreSaved_DataMapObj', stores the mapping of
proteomics evidence and evolutionary conservation evidence to the strain's
genome. The raw proteomics mass spectra data came from  ProteomeXchange
dataset PXD006551. The related genomes used to determine evolutionary
conservation all came from the genus Lactobacillus, and links to their
sequences were downloaded from NCBI's Genome Browser. The object was built
using the \code{MapAssessmentData} function from the \pkg{AssessORF}
package.
}

\section{Results objects}{

The 4 results objects, 'ATCC11842_PreSaved_ResultsObj_GenBank',
'ATCC11842_PreSaved_ResultsObj_GeneMarkS2',
'ATCC11842_PreSaved_ResultsObj_Glimmer', and
'ATCC11842_PreSaved_ResultsObj_Prodigal', store how much evidence there is
supporting or against each gene in a set of predicted genes for the strain's
genome. The four objects were built using the \code{AssessGenes} function
from the \pkg{AssessORF} package, a set of genes, and the mapping object
described here.

For the GenBank object, the genes were downloaded from the
corresponding record in the GenBank database. For the other three objects,
GenemarkS-2 (web server), Prodigal (2.6.3), and Glimmer (3.02) were run at
default settings in order to generate the set of predicted genes for the
corresponding results object.

The \code{GeneLeftPos}, \code{GeneRightPos}, and the \code{GeneStrand}
within each of the four results objects provide positional information on
the set of predicted genes used to generate that object.

The \code{GeneSource} list item within each of the four results objects
describes where the predicted genes came from (either "GenBank",
"GeneMarkS2", "Glimmer", or "Prodigal" respectively).
